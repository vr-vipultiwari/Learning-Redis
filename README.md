Q1. What is redis all about?

Ans:- Redis is a database that means we can use it for persisting information for any kind of app information like user accounts, blog posts, comments and so on.
       After storing information, we can then retrieve it later on by writing queries. Now, this behavior is similar to just about every other database out there.
       
Q2. How it's is different and why do we decide to use this over any other database?

Ans:- The answer is simple , It is incredibly fast. Redis can store and retrieve data extremely fast.  
      Redis is fast because of primarily three reasons below 
     
      All data stored in memory :
      Most databases store all their information between both the memory of a computer and a hard drive.
      Accessing data in memory is fast, but getting data that is stored on the hard disk is relatively slow.
